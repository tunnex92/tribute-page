            <strong>Remembering Steve Jobs</strong><br> Do not write in English very well, but I did my best to express
            the void
            in the world will have after the death of this genius The world lost an incredible person, a genius
            that mankind will miss. Jobs made a progress in 56 years something that mankind will take at least 100
            years to execute the same. His death will leave a void in the world and the feeling that we lost a genius.
            my condolences<br>

            <strong>Remembering Steve Job</strong> <br>Steve Jobs has honestly influenced my life so much.
            I'm proud to say I'm emailing this message right now on my Macbook Pro, with my iTouch,
            iPod Nano, and Macbook are close by. It took one man to change technology forever.
            He made such an impact on every customer, always with pleasing products.
            I remember how upset I was after hearing he had resigned from his position,
            only to find out months later, he had passed away. He was a great man with a talent
            and passion for technology like no other.<div class="author">Tunnex from Nigeria</div> <br><br>
            <strong>Condolences</strong><br>
            What an amazing human being. When I was 15, i received my first apple computer in 1984 and have not
            stopped to marvel at his genius, and have loved the culture of Mac that Steve built.
            Though I only met him once, he was one of the few people that I looked up too, and visioned of working at
            Apple ever since. Let his legacy be that he has developed not only a company that builds technology
            equipment
            but of creating the culture of Mac that so many have joined and relished over the last 30 yearsâ€¦.
            A way of life for millions of people that the rest of the world only now is beginning to understand.
            God bless you Steve and may you live forever in our hearts<div class="author">Scott</div> <br>
            <strong>Remembering Steve Job</strong><br>
            Hello, I've recently become part of the Apple team. I'd like to take this opportunity to celebrate a person
            with whom I would have enjoyed having a conversation.<br><br>
            <strong>What a Life!</strong><br> Just home from work, wake up my iMac, and the news of Steve's death greets
            me
            on the New York Times main page. Flip on MSNBC and the tributes are already running. I am stunned and
            greatly
            saddened. It feels like a death in the family. What an incomparable person he was. What a life he had.
            What a legacy he leaves!<br>
            <div class="author">Lindsay</div><br>
            <strong>A Tremendous Loss to Mankind</strong><br>This is indeed a very sad day that words cannot describe.
            I can't hardly think of any single person in modern day who has done more to improve and enrich the lives of
            our fellow Americans and people the world over than Mr. Jobs.
            What a tremendous loss to mankind. I am grieving for us all. May he rest in peace.<br>
